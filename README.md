## ðŸ–– Hello, I am Gustavo!


 â€” a passionate and driven **web developer** with strong proficiency in building **full-stack** applications using the **MERN** technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Information Systems** at **UFSC** and also taking a technical course in **Systems Development** at **SENAC**, where I continue to strengthen my foundation in software development.

**Fluent in English**, Iâ€™m comfortable working in diverse and international environments. Beyond coding, Iâ€™ve been a **professional chess player** since 2019, which has sharpened my strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and focus â€” qualities I bring into every project I take on.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and build innovative digital solutions that make an impact.
